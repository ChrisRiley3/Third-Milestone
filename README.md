# Gamer Gram - Third Milestone Project

Hello and welcome to my Third Milestone project, Gamer Gram is not just any only gaming site it is a hub, a place for every gamer out there who has had the same stuggle as me when it comes
to finding new games to play. When visiting the site you will find all sorts of informatiomn about excluisve only titles, however the best bit is yet to come. Why not navigate over to the
suggested games page and interact with other users and locate games they have recommended them sleves. If you feel like you have played a game recently that you just have to get out there
for more people to enjoy why not add it to the list for everyone to see, dont worry about making any mistakes you can edit and delete your posts whenever you feel its necessary. 

The website is quite easy to navigate round which makes it very suitable for users of all ages. My goal is simple I want gamers to be able to find new games without clicking link after
link and getting redirected to unwanted websites, with Gamer Gram what you see it what you get so get browsing, who knows you next favourite game could be one click away.

# UX

This project uses skills that I have acquired by working through the course, also this site includes skills that I have learned through my own research to supply the users with a fully 
responsive website that will complete every gamers needs. The aim for this website is to supply gamers with a hub where they can come to find new games to play and interact with other gamers. 
If a gamer should stumble across a game new or old that they must share with the gaming world then they can add that game to the suggested games page. You might think surely every gamer must 
already know of every game out there, I can promise you being a huge gamer myself this is not true recently I bought a Nintendo, it was a whole new gaming experience for me not playing any new 
Nintendo games for years. It took me a good week to find a game that was really for me. Every site I visited was over complicated and overcrowded with information hence why I have supplied 
every gamer with Gamer Gram. This website welcomes gamers, it does not over complicate things and does not have information overload, Gamer Gram is straight to the point and inviting.

* The user wants to know more about the website and what information they are going to find on the website. For this information they should navigate to the home page of the website. 
This is easily done by simply loading up the website it is the first page that will load up here they users will be able to find all the information they need about Gamer Gram.

* The user wants to know more about exclusive games, they have just got a new console and don’t really know many exclusive games. For this the user should navigate over to the 
console section in the navigation bar, when they click this they will see a dropdown menu with the console of their choice all they simply have to do is click the console they 
want and they will be redirected to the page displaying information about exclusive games to that console.

* The user wants to know other peoples suggested games, they want to know what their fellow gamers are playing so they can share the same experience the other gamer went through when they 
played the game. To do this the user will navigate to the suggested games page they can find this as ether a link on the home page all they have to do is click the suggested games button 
displayed on the home page or they can click the suggested games link in the navigation bar. Once the user is on the suggested games pages, they will see all the information they desire 
about what their fellow gamers are suggesting to play.

* The user has just recently played a game that they must share with the rest of the gaming community. To do this all they have to do is navigate over to the suggested games page once again 
and they will see a button with “Add Game” on it. Once they click this button, they will be redirected to a page that displays a table for the user to fill out and complete. On completion of 
the table they should click the submit button, this will then redirect the user back to the suggested games page however this time their suggested game will be displayed on the page.

* The user has just submitted their own suggested game for other gamers to enjoy but they realise they have made a mistake when filling out the table, they need to edit it. To do this the user 
should navigate to their post and underneath the title of the game they will see an Edit button. By clicking this button, they will be redirected to the edit game page. Once again, the user
will see the same table that they were asked to fill out in the add game pages however this time the table will already have all the information typed in from the post so it can be easily 
edited by the user instead of having to fill out the full table again. Once they are happy, they should submit the table again and they will be able to see the changes made to the post.

* The user has changed their mind and does not think the game will be a popular choice for their fellow gamers to play so they want to delete the post. This is simple the user should navigate 
to their post that they want to delete and click the Delete button. This is displayed next to the edit button. Once the user clicks this button, they will be redirected back to the suggested 
games page and their suggestion will have been deleted.

# Features

* Navigation: The website will come with a fully responsive navigate bar, this means no matter what device the user is using the navigation menu will always be there. This allows the user 
to navigate around the website freely and allows the user to understand exactly what page they are loading when they click a navigation link. The nav bar is located near the top of the page 
on every page so it is simple for the user to locate and will avoid the user from getting confused when navigating around the different pages Gamer Gram has to offer.

* Consoles: The consoles feature is one of the main reasons a user will have to visiting the website. This feature is where users will come to if they have ether bought a new console and are 
looking for exclusive games for that console, or some users may have had a console for a good few years like myself and didn’t realise a certain game was exclusive to that console. By navigating 
to this feature, they will find all the information they need.

* Suggested Games: This is this biggest feature of Gamer Gram. This page give the users the ability to interact with not only each other but the website itself, here the user will be able to locate 
the suggested games of their fellow gamers, also the user will be able to add suggested games they have played. Users can edit their posts maybe add more information to it or amend information they 
have already written. If the user feels they want to delete one of their suggested games, then they can also do that. This page offers everything the users want to interact.

* Add Game: This feature gives the user the ability to fill out a table of information about the game they want to suggest to other users. The feature is simple so its useable for people of all ages.

* Edit Game: This feature gives the user the ability to edit a prior post they have submitted for their fellow gamers to view. the user wont have to fill out all the inforamtion again once they are 
on the page the user will see all the inforamtion they have previously written all they will have to do is ether amend the inforamtion they neede to or add more inforamtion to it.

# Future Features

* User Content: This feature will allow users to upload their own content such as gameplay. This will allow the users to have even more interaction between themselves and allow other users 
acquire more information about that certain game. For example, if one user is stuck on a certain part and cant complete it they could navigate over to this feature and see how other users are 
playing to overcome this. 

* Leader boards:  The main purpose of the site is to have user interaction, by adding this as a future feature I will be doing just that, users will be able to compete to beat each other’s high 
scores on games. Gamer Gram could supply a weekly or monthly give away for its users with the top high scores in certain games to make the interaction more exciting.

* Consoles: By designing the consoles page the way I have it will make it quite simple and easy to add more consoles to this page. As the site build in popularity more and more gamers will be 
visiting and so more consoles must be added. There is a massive list of consoles out there no one said they had to be new one, eventually they will be a full section dedicated to retro gamers 
out there. 

* Competitive: This will be a huge new feature to Gamer Gram. Here I will be allowing users to create their own teams and go head to head with other teams creating more interaction between users. 
Users will compete in their game of choice and upload their results to the website. Gamer Gram will then put the results in a table displaying the best teams out there. This could lead to 
competitions being organised which yet again will cause more user interaction.

# Testing

When it came to test my code i used w3c validator, they offer a free service where you can input your code and they will tell you any adjustment you need to make to it. for my html i used 
[https://validator.w3.org/], and to validate my css i used [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] and for python i used [http://pep8online.com/checkresult]. When you arrive at the first two 
sites all you have to do is navigate over to the "by direct input" section and copy and paste your code in the box provided you will then go ahead and click check, this will check the code that 
you have entered and come back with any errors and adjustments you may need to make However beacuse i am using Flask and inhereting tempates the HTML5 validator doesn't take this into consideration 
so although it shows some errors they are all related to me using Flask so the code itself is fine. When using the python validator all you have to do is copy and paste your python code in the 
window that states place your code here once you click check code you will see all it states is my commenting lines are to long however the code itself is good.

Every page on Gamer Gram has been tested over and over again to make sure when it is finally deployed it is suitable to be a fully functioning website. Starting off with the navigation bar I made 
sure that it is fully responsive on every page so no matter what device the user might be using they can access the full potential of the site. When the user is navigating round the website using 
a smaller device, I have made sure that the hamburger menu works properly and made sure that all the links work and direct you to the correct page when clicked using the hamburger menu. When 
operating the website in a normal window I have also checked that all the links work correctly and I have tested the CSS I have applied to the linked when hovered over works correctly.

When testing the home page, I tested that it was fully responsive, so it looks good on every sized screen. I checked that the button works appropriately on the home screen so it redirects you to 
the suggested games page when clicked.

Testing the consoles page the first thing I did was made sure that the consoles dropdown in the navigation bar works appropriately so when clicked it drop downs the different console’s the user 
can choose from that they are wanting to know more information about. Once I was happy that this worked and was fully responsive, I started to check every link that the dropdown supplies. I first 
checked that the CSS was being accessed and working properly when the links are hovered over. I then clicked on every link in the console dropdown and made sure that it redirected the user to the 
correct page that they are wishing to access. Once I was on these pages I yet again made sure that the page was fully responsive and looked good in every window size.

I came into a couple of bugs when it came to testing my suggested games page. First of all i was trying to get the game genre to display but for some reason it wasnt working. This was a simple bug 
fix. First I navigated over to my mongo database the and the solution was quite clear I was writing {{ game.game_genre }} thinking that this was what it was called in my database however it was 
simply just spelled genre. So i altered my code to {{ game.genre }} and it started displaying correctly.

This next bug took me a little while to figure out. I am using a bootstrap template to display my suggested games. Because I am iterating through my mongo database with a for loop I only need to 
take part of the collapse template not the full thing. But because I am only using one part it also means the ID's will be the same for all of the suggested games so once one suggested game was 
clicked and the information about the game opened up it meant that all the games that are on the page will also open up to display their information to. So it seems like the solution is simple 
give the ID of the collapsible template something that the games dont have in common. So I changed the ID to {{ game._id }}, every new game added to the database automatically is given its own unique 
ID, so technically this should work. However it did not by doing this it broke the whole thing completly so i had to go back to step one and find out what was actually causing the collapse to work. 
I found out that in the card-header of the template the data-target and aria-controls were causing the collapse to work but also in the div holding the card-body the ID was causing this to work. 
So I tried changing them all to the games unique ID once more and it still did not work. I needed to try something else, next I treid using the games description as something that was unique, this 
worked but only if the game title and game description didnt have any spaces or numbers in it so this was obviously going to be a problem. Next I treid changing my python code in app.py, if you
navigate to the suggested app.route you will see that i have created a list and iterated through that list and made my own custom game id. I then replaced the current game title with my new unique 
ID that I have just made and made it so their is no white space and finally I got the collapse feature working exactly how I wanted it to.


Once I had all the bugs for the suggested page figured out I could start to test it. I tested all the buttons on the page worked properly and that the correct buttons redirected you to the correct 
page the user was trying to access. I tested that the page was fully responsive and that it looked good on smaller devices. I checked that the delete button worked as it was meant to and it did.

I checked that the “Add Game” button worked correctly and when it was clicked it redirected the user to the add game page. Once on this page I checked if it was fully responsive and if the table 
worked as it was meant to. I checked that it was accessing my database correctly by checking the genres that are on offer for the user to select. Once I was happy with what I had written in the 
table I clicked the add game button at the bottom of the page and made sure it redirected me back to the suggested games page and that my game had now been added to the page. I tested a whole 
load of games to make sure that any input would work for example I tested numbers and spaces in the game title and also the game description to see if the game would still be added and to see 
if the game would still display information as it is meant to on the suggested games page. 

The edit game page was also tested the same as the add game page. I checked that when the edit button was clicked that it redirected you to the edit game page. However, this time I checked that 
what the user had previously written in the form field was still displaying in the form, so the user did not have to write the whole thing out again. I checked this page was fully responsive. 
Also I checked that when the user was happy with the editing that they had done that when they clicked the edit game button at the bottom of the page it redirected them back to the suggested game 
page with the edited version of their game. 

# Deployment

To create this webpage I used Gitpod and online IDE and downloaded Flask to be able to access the framework I needed. I then initilised a new git repository by downloading the template provied by 
code institute. This allowed me to have all the neccessary things in place when starting a new project in gitpod. You can find my github repository here 
[https://github.com/ChrisRiley3/Third-Milestone]. I was then all set up to start pushing completed code to my github repository. as i worked though the project I made plenty of commits and 
named them accordingly so if I ever needed to go back a few steps I could do so easily. Once I was happy with the webpage I could then make the site live by using Heroku. The finished site 
can be found at [].

The bootstrap Theme I used to create the site can be found at: [https://startbootstrap.com/themes/business-casual/]. I also added In some extra code from bootstrap itself. The dropdown menu used 
in the navigation bar can be found at [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/], also the collapsable item I used in my suggested games page can be found at 
[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/collapse/]. The text supplied In all the consoles pages is from [https://www.wikipedia.org/] I took ether the first paragraph when you first
open the game on wiki and sometimes the opening paragraph from the gameplay section of the game. 

I downloaded and used the flask framework and accessed data from my MongoDB

### Acknowledgements

The inspiration for this project came to me one day when I was really struggling to find game I might like when I bought my own nintendo. I wanted to create something that would be a hub for gamers 
like myself who are always wanting to find and play new games.
