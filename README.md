# Gamer Gram - Third Milestone Project

Hello and welcome to my Third Milestone project, Gamer Gram is not just any only gaming site it is a hub, a place for every gamer out there who has had the same stuggle as me when it comes
to finding new games to play. When visiting the site you will find all sorts of informatiomn about excluisve only titles, however the best bit is yet to come. Why not navigate over to the
suggested games page and interact with other users and locate games they have recommended them sleves. If you feel like you have played a game recently that you just have to get out there
for more people to enjoy why not add it to the list for everyone to see, dont worry about making any mistakes you can edit and delete your posts whenever you feel its necessary. 

The website is quite easy to navigate round which makes it very suitable for users of all ages. My goal is simple I want gamers to be able to find new games without clicking link after
link and getting redirected to unwanted websites, with Gamer Gram what you see it what you get so get browsing, who knows you next favourite game could be one click away.

# UX

This project uses skills that I have acquired by working through the course, also this site includes skills that I have learned through my own research to supply the users with a fully 
responsive website that will complete every gamers needs. The aim for this website is to supply gamers with a hub where they can come to find new games to play and interact with other gamers. 
If a gamer should stumble across a game new or old that they must share with the gaming world then they can add that game to the suggested games page. You might think surely every gamer must 
already know of every game out there, I can promise you being a huge gamer myself this is not true recently I bought a Nintendo, it was a whole new gaming experience for me not playing any new 
Nintendo games for years. It took me a good week to find a game that was really for me. Every site I visited was over complicated and overcrowded with information hence why I have supplied 
every gamer with Gamer Gram. This website welcomes gamers, it does not over complicate things and does not have information overload, Gamer Gram is straight to the point and inviting.

* The user wants to know more about the website and what information they are going to find on the website. For this information they should navigate to the home page of the website. 
This is easily done by simply loading up the website it is the first page that will load up here they users will be able to find all the information they need about Gamer Gram.

* The user wants to know more about exclusive games, they have just got a new console and don’t really know many exclusive games. For this the user should navigate over to the 
console section in the navigation bar, when they click this they will see a dropdown menu with the console of their choice all they simply have to do is click the console they 
want and they will be redirected to the page displaying information about exclusive games to that console.

* The user wants to know other peoples suggested games, they want to know what their fellow gamers are playing so they can share the same experience the other gamer went through when they 
played the game. To do this the user will navigate to the suggested games page they can find this as ether a link on the home page all they have to do is click the suggested games button 
displayed on the home page or they can click the suggested games link in the navigation bar. Once the user is on the suggested games pages, they will see all the information they desire 
about what their fellow gamers are suggesting to play.

* The user has just recently played a game that they must share with the rest of the gaming community. To do this all they have to do is navigate over to the suggested games page once again 
and they will see a button with “Add Game” on it. Once they click this button, they will be redirected to a page that displays a table for the user to fill out and complete. On completion of 
the table they should click the submit button, this will then redirect the user back to the suggested games page however this time their suggested game will be displayed on the page.

* The user has just submitted their own suggested game for other gamers to enjoy but they realise they have made a mistake when filling out the table, they need to edit it. To do this the user 
should navigate to their post and underneath the title of the game they will see an Edit button. By clicking this button, they will be redirected to the edit game page. Once again, the user
will see the same table that they were asked to fill out in the add game pages however this time the table will already have all the information typed in from the post so it can be easily 
edited by the user instead of having to fill out the full table again. Once they are happy, they should submit the table again and they will be able to see the changes made to the post.

* The user has changed their mind and does not think the game will be a popular choice for their fellow gamers to play so they want to delete the post. This is simple the user should navigate 
to their post that they want to delete and click the Delete button. This is displayed next to the edit button. Once the user clicks this button, they will be redirected back to the suggested 
games page and their suggestion will have been deleted.

# Features

* Navigation: The website will come with a fully responsive navigate bar, this means no matter what device the user is using the navigation menu will always be there. This allows the user 
to navigate around the website freely and allows the user to understand exactly what page they are loading when they click a navigation link. The nav bar is located near the top of the page 
on every page so it is simple for the user to locate and will avoid the user from getting confused when navigating around the different pages Gamer Gram has to offer.

* Consoles: The consoles feature is one of the main reasons a user will have to visiting the website. This feature is where users will come to if they have ether bought a new console and are 
looking for exclusive games for that console, or some users may have had a console for a good few years like myself and didn’t realise a certain game was exclusive to that console. By navigating 
to this feature, they will find all the information they need.

* Suggested Games: This is this biggest feature of Gamer Gram. This page give the users the ability to interact with not only each other but the website itself, here the user will be able to locate 
the suggested games of their fellow gamers, also the user will be able to add suggested games they have played. Users can edit their posts maybe add more information to it or amend information they 
have already written. If the user feels they want to delete one of their suggested games, then they can also do that. This page offers everything the users want to interact.

* Add Game: This feature gives the user the ability to fill out a table of information about the game they want to suggest to other users. The feature is simple so its useable for people of all ages.

* Edit Game: This feature gives the user the ability to edit a prior post they have submitted for their fellow gamers to view. the user wont have to fill out all the inforamtion again once they are 
on the page the user will see all the inforamtion they have previously written all they will have to do is ether amend the inforamtion they neede to or add more inforamtion to it.

# Future Features

* User Content: This feature will allow users to upload their own content such as gameplay. This will allow the users to have even more interaction between themselves and allow other users 
acquire more information about that certain game. For example, if one user is stuck on a certain part and cant complete it they could navigate over to this feature and see how other users are 
playing to overcome this. 

* Leader boards:  The main purpose of the site is to have user interaction, by adding this as a future feature I will be doing just that, users will be able to compete to beat each other’s high 
scores on games. Gamer Gram could supply a weekly or monthly give away for its users with the top high scores in certain games to make the interaction more exciting.

* Consoles: By designing the consoles page the way I have it will make it quite simple and easy to add more consoles to this page. As the site build in popularity more and more gamers will be 
visiting and so more consoles must be added. There is a massive list of consoles out there no one said they had to be new one, eventually they will be a full section dedicated to retro gamers 
out there. 

* Competitive: This will be a huge new feature to Gamer Gram. Here I will be allowing users to create their own teams and go head to head with other teams creating more interaction between users. 
Users will compete in their game of choice and upload their results to the website. Gamer Gram will then put the results in a table displaying the best teams out there. This could lead to 
competitions being organised which yet again will cause more user interaction.
